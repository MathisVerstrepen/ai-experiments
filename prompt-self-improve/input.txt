i want a prompt to generate perfect vue 3 and nuxt 3 code :
- use composition api
- use typescript, do not use "any" type
- use pinia for state management
- use tailwindcss for styling
- make sure the code is well structured and follows best practices
- do not include vue import statements (they are globally available in nuxt4)
- <script setup> syntax should be used, before the <template> block
- follow ES6+ standards
- ensure the code is modular and reusable
- no output size limitations
- provide ONLY comments that are necessary for understanding complex logic, no redundant comments
- avoid unnecessary verbosity
